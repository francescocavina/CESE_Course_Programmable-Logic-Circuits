## About this repository

This respository is used for exercises and a final practical work from the Programmable Logic Circuits course (2023). This course belongs to the Master's Degree in Embedded Systems at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA).

The exercises and the final work are coded in VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language). 

The instructions for the exercises can be found in the "VHDL Exercises - ES.pdf" file. 

### About the final work

The final work is a hardware description for a floating point adder (simple and double precision) that uses a Moore FSM (Finite State Machine). 

In order to simulate the design, the software simulator for testbenches GTKWave was used. 

Moreover, the description was also synthesized, implemented and programmed into an Arty-Z7-10 FPGA kit from Digilent using the synthesis tool Vivado from Xilinx.
